# Space-Invaders_Group-10

Our task was to create a Space Invaders game using only modules from the python standard library, particularly the turtle module. Space Invaders is a classic arcade game originally released in 1978. The game involves a player controlling a spaceship at the bottom of the screen, tasked with defeating a wave of enemies (i.e., aliens) that gradually move across and down the screen. 

Requirements of our game: • Player spaceship - A ship that the player moves horizontally along the bottom of the screen to avoid enemy attacks and fire bullets to destroy enemy ships. • Enemy aliens - A grid of alien ships that move left to right and descend towards the player’s spaceship. The aliens increase their speed as their numbers decrease. • Bullet interaction - Bullets fired by the player should destroy enemies upon collision. A score should be displayed for each enemy destroyed. Aliens can fire bullets too. • Winning condition: The player wins by eliminating all alien ships before they descend to the player’s level. • Losing condition: The game ends if an alien reaches the player’s level or the player’s spaceship is hit by an alien projectile.

The sounds used are sourced from orange free sounds. The gifs are found online. Two versions of the game are included, one with sounds and one without.
